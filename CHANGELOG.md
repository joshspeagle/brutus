## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

Systematic audit of every module outside the `BruteForce` hot path (covered in
1.1.1): population fitting, LOS dust, offsets, stellar models, priors, dust
maps, plotting, data loading, and utilities. 113 verified findings were fixed
across pull requests #61-#69, each with a regression test (the suite grew from
725 to over 1000 tests). Highlights below; full details are in the PR
descriptions. Items marked *(output-changing)* alter numerical results — in
every case toward the statistically correct answer.

### Fixed — statistical correctness *(output-changing)*

- **Cluster fitting**: binary modeling was silently non-functional (an
  `smf=` keyword typo swallowed by `**kwargs`); post-MS models were
  underweighted ~21x; the (mass, SMF) integration measure is now normalized;
  the uniform outlier model is a proper density (it previously *favored*
  flagging the best-measured stars as outliers).
- **LOS dust**: monotonicity constraints now apply to the effective
  extinction profile, and kernels renormalize for truncation at the
  reddening bounds.
- **Photometric offsets**: leave-one-out reweighting used incorrect
  importance weights, shrinking fitted-band offsets toward 1.
- **Priors**: metallicity/age priors were silently dropped when passed as
  plain arrays; the disk/halo normalization was inconsistent near the Sun;
  age-prior weights now condition on metallicity; the dust-map A(V) prior
  renormalizes over `avlim`.
- **Dust maps**: Bayestar queries honor the map's per-pixel reliability
  metadata by default (`apply_reliability_mask=False` restores raw values).
- **Plotting / post-processing**: distance posteriors regenerated from fit
  summaries were biased low (missing scale-to-distance Jacobian);
  `bin_pdfs_distred(cdf=True)` now cumulates along the reddening axis as
  documented; offset-diagnostic mask indexing fixed.
- **BruteForce**: parallax-based model pre-selection now uses the marginal
  (not conditional) scale uncertainty, so heavily reddened stars with good
  parallaxes no longer lose valid models before the posterior stage.
- **Utilities**: `quantile` uses one midpoint-CDF convention for weighted
  and unweighted input (unweighted values shift slightly); truncated-normal
  densities are tail-stable; a singular covariance in a batch no longer
  corrupts the parallel sampler.

### Fixed — robustness and API contracts

- Silent failure modes now raise clear errors: omitting a multi-valued grid
  axis (was quietly pinned to the grid edge), zero surviving filters in
  `load_models` (which also now drops a constant `afe` column), a dust map
  without sky coordinates, invalid `avlim`, mis-shaped weights/coordinates
  in the plotting utilities, and half-specified offset priors.
- NaN fluxes and zero errors are masked per band instead of invalidating
  the whole object; generated grids no longer contain invalid models;
  caller-supplied arrays (`lnprior`, `hist2d_kwargs`, labels) are no longer
  mutated in place.
- Additions: `dustfile` accepts `pathlib.Path`; `bin_pdfs_distred` /
  `dist_vs_red` support importance weights and multi-object input;
  `phot_loglike` supports shared model grids and extra chi-square terms;
  `draw_sar` gained `max_attempts` (its RNG stream changed, so fixed-seed
  draws differ; the distribution is verified identical).

### Performance (equivalence-tested)

Grid generation 16.7x per model; photometric-offset calibration ~12x
end-to-end; LOS dust likelihood up to 4.2x (prior transform 51x);
`draw_sar` 2.6-4.5x; `Bayestar()` init 8x; galactic prior 1.75x
(`logp_extinction` ~9x); `Isochrone` memory roughly halved; `EEPTracks`
caches ~264 MB smaller (now versioned `_cachev2.pkl`).

### Infrastructure

- The `docs` CI check no longer fails instantly on every pull request: the
  build was decoupled from the master-only GitHub Pages deployment
  environment, so PRs now actually build the documentation (deploys still
  run only from master).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-27

Performance pass on the individual-star `BruteForce` fitter (`loglike_grid` ->
`logpost_grid` -> `_fit`). Benchmarked on the real MIST grid (`grid_mist_v9.h5`,
613,530 models) and the real Orion field (Gaia parallaxes), across a cohort
spanning the full selected-model range (4 .. the `max_models=50000` cap).
End-to-end **~2.6x faster `loglike_grid`, ~2.3x faster `fit()`** on a 4-core host
(the parallel kernels scale further with physical cores). Every change is either
verified bitwise-identical in the saved (float32) outputs or proven *more
accurate* against a high-Nmc reference; see `bench/RESULTS.md` for the full
methodology and numbers.

### Changed

- **Monte-Carlo prior integration in `logpost_grid` now uses antithetic
  sampling** *(affects output -- more accurate)*: the per-model prior integral
  draws the proposal normals in antithetic pairs `(z, -z)`. The estimator stays
  unbiased; because the integrand is dominated along `ln(d)` by the
  galactic-density falloff and the `+log(d)` volume Jacobian (both monotone in
  the sampling direction), this cuts the MC-integration variance ~20x and reduces
  the finite-`Nmc` (Jensen) bias of `log(mean(w))`. Versus an `Nmc -> inf` gold
  standard the per-model log-posterior RMSE drops to ~0.28x and the bias 3-65x,
  at the same `Nmc` and half the Gaussian draws. The resulting shift in posterior
  summaries is within the procedure's intrinsic Monte-Carlo scatter. An
  adversarial review confirmed the one regime where antithetic could mildly
  *increase* variance (a very precise parallax centered on the photometric
  proposal mode with poorly-constraining photometry) is empirically negligible
  for real Gaia data (worst observed std ratio ~1.06) and never introduces bias.
- **`mc_ess` output is now a weight-concentration diagnostic, not a strict
  effective-sample count**: under antithetic correlation `1 / sum(w_i^2)` no
  longer counts independent samples (it can read up to ~2x optimistic for
  well-mixed models). It remains monotone and useful as a proposal/target
  mismatch indicator -- low values still flag poor overlap.
- `sample_multivariate_normal` gained an optional `antithetic` keyword (default
  `False`); `logp_galactic_structure` gained optional `feh`/`loga` array keywords
  (a fast path for the per-point metallicity/age prior). Existing calls are
  unaffected.

### Performance

All of the following are verified **bitwise-identical** to the prior results in
the saved `fit()` outputs (any differences are float64 round-off below float32
storage precision that flip no discrete selection):

- `loglike_grid`'s per-model numba kernels (`_get_seds`, `_optimize_fit_mag`,
  `_optimize_fit_flux`, `_get_sed_mle`) and the multivariate-normal sampler are
  parallelized with `prange` (rows are independent; reductions are exact). The
  two convergence max-reductions in `_optimize_fit_mag` are parallelized as well.
- Removed dead computation in `_get_sed_mle` (`models_int`/`reddening` were
  computed -- 4.9M `pow` calls per evaluation -- but never read).
- Fused kernels `_chi2_from_resid` and `_init_mag_resid` replace large NumPy
  temporaries; `np.zeros` -> `np.empty` for fully-overwritten arrays.
- `_get_seds` flux conversion uses `exp(fac*mag)` instead of `10**(-0.4*mag)`
  (~1.6x faster on that hot path; agreement ~1e-15).
- The batched 3x3 covariance regularization uses an analytic symmetric-3x3
  minimum-eigenvalue kernel instead of `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` (no less accurate;
  the regularization decision is unchanged).
- `logpost_grid` no longer tiles a *structured* label array across all MC
  samples for the default galactic prior (a numpy structured-dtype `np.tile` is
  ~100x slower than the float equivalent; it dominated logpost for large
  selected-model counts). It now hands the prior the per-point `feh`/`loga` as
  plain float arrays. Bitwise-identical; ~1.24x faster `logpost_grid` at
  `Nsel=50000` (~165 ms/object), no change for small selections.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-29

Maintenance and polish release: verified bug fixes (several affecting numerical
output on specific paths), documentation accuracy, test-suite hygiene, and
release-process improvements. All fixes ship with regression tests.

### Fixed

- **`FastNN.encode` silent mis-scaling for 6-sample batches** *(affects output)*:
  a 2-D input of shape `(6 params, 6 samples)` broadcast against the parameter
  bounds without error and normalized along the wrong axis, producing silently
  corrupted SEDs/bolometric corrections only when exactly 6 valid samples were
  evaluated (reached via `StellarPop` synthesis). Now dispatches on input
  dimensionality explicitly.
- **`los_dust` kernels collapsing per-object cloud means** *(affects output)*:
  `kernel_gauss`/`kernel_lorentz`/`kernel_tophat` collapsed an array-valued mean
  to a scalar, so line-of-sight fits using a reddening template (`template_reds`,
  `additive_foreground`) evaluated every object against object 0's cloud mean.
  Means are now kept broadcastable. The default uniform-cloud path is unchanged.
- **Binary companions no longer discard a valid primary SED** *(affects binary
  grid generation)*: `StarEvolTrack.get_seds` returned an all-NaN combined SED
  (dropping the valid primary) when the secondary's age could not be matched to
  the unrealistically tight default tolerance. The default `tol` is relaxed
  `1e-6 -> 1e-2` dex and a primary-only fallback is used when the companion does
  not converge. *Regenerate binary (smf>0) grids to benefit; single-star fitting
  and the shipped default grids are unaffected.*
- `load_offsets` no longer crashes on a single-filter offsets file.
- `logp_imf` no longer raises `ZeroDivisionError` for a power-law slope of
  exactly 1.0 (flat-in-log); uses the logarithmic mass integral.
- `_fetch` (data download) removes a stale/broken symlink before re-linking and
  falls back to a file copy on filesystems without symlink support.
- `BruteForce.logpost_grid` floors the Monte-Carlo sample count at 1 (a very
  small `mem_lim` could drive it to 0 and crash).
- `BruteForce.loglike_grid` guards the dimensional-prior `log(Ndim)` term and
  fails fast with a clear error on a fully-masked object (was an opaque
  `ZeroDivisionError` deep in the optimizer).
- `cornerplot` no longer mutates a caller-supplied `labels` list in place.
- `dist_vs_red` uses `interpolation="none"` so binned PDF images show raw bins;
  fixed a no-op smoothing guard in `hist2d`.
- Removed a dead `from scipy import polyfit` import (`scipy` has no top-level
  `polyfit`; the code always used `numpy.polyfit`).

### Changed

- **Python support**: dropped end-of-life Python 3.8 (`requires-python>=3.9`);
  added 3.13 to the classifiers and tooling targets.
- **Dependencies**: raised the `numba` floor to `>=0.59.0` (the old 0.53 floor
  predates `numpy>=1.22`/2.x support); `numpy` remains uncapped (the code is
  numpy-2.0 clean, verified on 2.2).
- **Documentation engine**: standardized on a single NumPy-docstring processor
  (`napoleon`); removed the redundant `numpydoc` extension. The docs now build
  with zero warnings.
- **Tutorials**: standardized on the committed `Orion_l209.1_b-19.9` example
  field; replaced chi2/Nbands quality cuts with goodness-of-fit p-values.

### Documentation

- Corrected numerous stale code examples across the docs and docstrings to match
  the real API (`StarGrid(models, labels)`, `get_seds` 3-tuple in magnitudes,
  `magnitude(flux, err)`, `sample_multivariate_normal(size=)`, the prior call
  signatures, `samps_dred`, the data cache path/env var, real filter names, and
  the maggies flux convention).
- Added `summary_plot` to the API reference; documented `BruteForce.fit`'s
  performance/accuracy parameters (`max_models`, `precision_shrinkage`,
  `subsample_mode`, `R_solar`, `Z_solar`); reframed fit-quality guidance around
  the p-value methodology.

### Testing & packaging

- Added regression tests covering every fix above; reconciled the `conftest`
  coverage guidance with what CI actually runs
  (`NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1 pytest --cov`); the default `pytest` run no longer
  enables coverage (which crashed on some WSL/DrvFs paths).
- Added a tag-triggered PyPI publish workflow (Trusted Publishing); fixed the
  stale `MANIFEST.in` data-file path.
